## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list
of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your group’s interface from Project Two**. Share with
your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you’ve found:

1. https://teamsuccess.io/UX
2. https://airtable.com/shrZjdeR1ExPdNuOx/tbl6py59pxp1Ndb2k/viwqJfYLNqurcIw88?blocks=hide

* Your own condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1. The layout flow is easy to follow.
2. Interactions with the page have visible feedback.
3. Content is positioned in proper hierarchy without solely depending on color.
4. Prices are clearly displayed along with any other essential information about the item without additional clicks.
5. Users can easily navigate to any page with minimal clicks while knowing their current location.
6. Buttons and Call-To-Actions are clearly labeled or highly intuitive
7. Text is easily readable with fonts having a strong relationship with one another.
8. Content is relevant and necessary. No extraneous information should be displayed which does not have purpose.
9. Appropriate input fields are used, designed for specific formats of input (name, dates, qty, etc.)
10. Strong sense of brand identity that allows users to understand what the site is about within 5 seconds.
