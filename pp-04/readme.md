## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:

* Android Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://material.io/design/color/color-usage.html#hierarchy
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
I tried to implement a strong contrast of colors between the background and key sections on the webpage. The header uses a bright blue with orange for the text. The use of these color with the neutral beige below allows the user to focus on the important parts of the page. The separate sections (Basic Membership, Premium Membership, etc.) also use a different color to catch the attention of the user.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL): https://material.io/design/color/color-usage.html#state
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
I used color to indicate the states of the interactive elements. The sections toggle from orange to blue depending on whether its expanded of collapsed. This draws the attention of the user towards the section they're interacting with. The options within the section (Option 1, Option 2, Student, Senior, etc.) also have a similar behavior. The selected option will turn the border orange to act as feedback to the user of what they selected.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
