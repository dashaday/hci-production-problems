## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=14g0u0kJS6KvW5fuP8MNdeqCnl7
Your Rationale: So for a gaming console, I'm going to steer away from the warm colors since gaming doesn't really involve too much passion and active energy, plus technology is associated more with cool colors. Within the cool colors, I'm going to cross out green and most shades of blue because that's already associated with the Xbox and PlayStation. That leaves me with a little room in blue and purple. Blue is a good color that establishes trust and confidence, but in order to make the brand more specific and unique, it would be better to go with purple. Dark purple also gives off that elite and sophisticated feeling which can set the new brand apart the others.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=55w0U0kg3++0W++9U++lC+XrfZS
Your Rationale: Springtime in nature shows a lot of green, pink, and yellow. It's hard to put green in an adjacent color palette because it sticks a little too close to blue (which I'm avoiding because it's cool) and too much of yellow (which just makes it look like lime). We can't do much of orange and red either because that's more of a fall color scheme. So we have to move towards the red/ pink area. We should focus more on a mid-range to high lightness to give off that sense of life blooming in. Moving to the pink area and adjusting the distance a bit, I settled for a pink-orange-violet combo.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=31U0U0kjs++6n+XdQ+ZoW+WuXZI
Your Rationale: Since the app is catered to children, we have to focus on primary colors. Often, these are the colors they can identify and name. As much as I wanted to get a turquoise-orange-purple theme, it won't be ideal to the kids. I went for a more primary-colored take and chose Yellow as the base color to give the kids more sense of energy and activeness. It's also gender-neutral. I turned down the saturation a bit as well so as not to hurt the kids' eyes.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=c421e4F3i0kRGu+tfN4PPPfSFoUTQiS
Your Rationale: Off the bat, I wanted to start my primary color as blue. This establishes security, confidence, and all the factors that you need for a cybersecurity site. Following that, I decided to have the complementary color (orange) in the palette. I'm a big believer in complementary colors since it always gives off a nice pop. The only thing left to figure out were the secondary colors. I stuck close to the cooler colorsand ended up with a blue-teal-violet-orange scheme.
